# Analysis of Song Trends within Spotify #
With this project  our team is going to be highlighting trends that make a song popular within the last ten years. We are aiming to provide featured artists, top reoccurring artists, and the popular genres.  



## Questions we want to answer within our research
* What makes a song popular? 
* What attributes (i.e. beats per minute, genre, key, tempo, danceability, etc.) can predict a song or artist's popularity?
* Which genres consistently chart on the most popular?
* What beats per minute range appears at the top of the chats?
* Which artists are reoccuring on chart?
