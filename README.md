## Selected Topic - Spotify Top Song Trends
What makes a song a top hit on Spotify? With this project, our team aims to highlight trends of top charting songs and determine if song popularity can be reliably predicted based on song attributes such as: beats per minute, genre, key, tempo, speechiness, and other features. (Reasoning for selection) We would like to look at song popularity broken down by featured artists, top recurring artists and popular genres (?)

## Questions We Want to Answer within Our Research
* What makes a song popular? 
* What attributes (i.e. beats per minute, genre, key, tempo, danceability, etc.) can predict a song or artist's popularity?
* Which genres consistently chart on the most popular?
* What beats per minute range appears at the top of the chats?
* Which artists are reoccuring on chart?

## Datasets

In total of two datasets will be used for this analysis. Our data includes information about the songs such as song name, song artist, and genre. Also included are popularity measures such as position/spotify ranking and number of streams as well as song attributes such as energy, tempo, danceability and etc.

The first dataset includes 10,000 Top Streamed Songs on Spotify and has the following variables:
